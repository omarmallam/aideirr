# Enhanced React Calculator

## Based on the Original Project

This project is an enhanced version of the React Calculator originally developed by Andrew H. Farmer. The base project provided a clean and functional implementation of simple arithmetic operations using React.

## New Features

### 1. Calculation History



The calculator now includes a collapsible history panel with the following features:

- Displays a list of all previous calculations  
- Allows users to click on a past calculation to reuse its result  
- Can be toggled open or closed  

**Implementation Details:**

- Introduced a new `History` component with a collapsible UI  
- Added state management for tracking history in the `App` component  
- Created logic to format and store expressions  
- Designed a user-friendly interface for interacting with previous calculations

### 2. Theme Toggle



A theme toggle button has been added to provide a better visual experience:

- Switch between light and dark modes  
- Theme preference is saved across sessions using localStorage  
- Helps reduce eye strain during night usage  

**Implementation Details:**

- Developed a `ThemeToggle` component  
- Used CSS variables for flexible theming  
- Stored user preferences in `localStorage`  
- Designed and applied a complete dark theme

## Development Process

### 1. Project Setup

- Forked and cloned the original repository  
- Installed all required dependencies  
- Verified the app was running properly  
- Analyzed the codebase to understand its structure  

### 2. Planning Features

- Outlined detailed plans for each enhancement  
- Identified which files needed updates  
- Decided on new components required  

### 3. Implementation with Aider

Used Aider AI to assist in incremental implementation:

- First, created and integrated the `History` component  
- Then, added the theme toggle functionality  
- Finally, implemented localStorage support for theme persistence  

### 4. Testing and Refinement

- Performed manual testing for all features  
- Fixed bugs and improved UI behavior  
- Wrote unit tests for the newly added components  
- Polished UX based on feedback and observation

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: History Panel Positioning  
**Problem**: The panel pushed layout content instead of floating over it.  
**Solution**: Switched to absolute positioning with a higher `z-index` for overlay behavior.

### Challenge 2: Theme Persistence  
**Problem**: Theme reset after page reload.  
**Solution**: Integrated `localStorage` to save and load the selected theme on startup.

### Challenge 3: Expression Formatting  
**Problem**: It was difficult to build readable history expressions.  
**Solution**: Designed a system to track operations and format expressions before saving them.

## Aider Commands Used

Various Aider commands helped streamline development:

- `/add` – Add files to Aider's context  
- `/ask` – Query codebase behavior or structure  
- `/edit` – Modify files collaboratively  
- `/ls` – List available project files  
- `/diff` – View changes before committing  
- `/run` – Launch development server  
- `/test` – Run test suites  
- `/commit` – Save changes with proper commit messages

## Future Improvements

- Add a "Clear History" feature  
- Support multiple theme options beyond light/dark  
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for faster input  
- Create an export function for the calculation history
